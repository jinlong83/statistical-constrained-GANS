# Statistical constrained GANs

In this project, we aim at improving the robustness of generative adversarial networks (GANs) by incorporating statistical constraints. More details about this project can be found in the poster within this repository.

## Getting Started

This work has been published on Journal of Computational Physics (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2019.109209), and the codes will be online soon.
